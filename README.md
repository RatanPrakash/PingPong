# PingPong

PingPong is a simple library to manage pings(prompt) and pongs(response). The main purpose of this library is to manage histories and contexts in LLM applied applications such as ChatGPT.

The basic motivations behind this project are:
- Abstract prompt and response so that any UIs and Prompt formats can be adopted
- Abstract context management strategies to apply any number of context managements
